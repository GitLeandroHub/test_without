                In this document, when we refer to &quot;<strong>we</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>us</strong>&quot; or
                &quot;<strong>our</strong>
                &quot;, we mean Parity; and when we refer to &quot;<strong>you</strong>&quot; or &quot;
                <strong>your</strong>&quot; we mean you, the person downloading, accessing and/or using the App.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>1. Understanding these terms</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                1.1 This end user licence agreement together with appendix 1 to it and our instructions referred to in
                it (this &quot;<strong>EULA</strong>&quot;) describes how you may download the App and access and/or use
                the App. By downloading, accessing and/or using the App, this EULA will apply to you and you agree to
                the terms of this EULA. You should therefore read the terms carefully before downloading, accessing
                and/or using the App. If any written instruction we have given you is inconsistent with the terms set
                out in this document, you should comply with our instructions and in doing so you will not be in breach
                of the inconsistent term of this document.
              </p>
              <p>
                1.2 When certain words and phrases are used in this EULA, they have specific meanings (these are known
                as &quot;<strong>defined terms</strong>&quot;). You can identify these defined terms because they start
                with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it
                has the meaning given to it in the section of this EULA where it was defined (you can find these
                meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included in brackets and speech marks).
              </p>
              <p>
                1.3 In order to access and/or use the App it must be downloaded on to a smartphone or other mobile
                device running either the iOS or Android operating systems (the device you use, &quot;
                <strong>Device</strong>
                &quot;). In order to download the App, you will need Internet access.
              </p>
              <p>1.4 Please note that:</p>
              <p>
                1.4.1 to download the App, you must also review and agree to the additional app terms set out in
                appendix 1 to this EULA and any other terms and conditions imposed by the app store from which you have
                downloaded the App; and
              </p>
              <p>
                1.4.2 we will not collect any personal information from or in relation to you, including from your
                downloading, accessing and/or use of the App. If you contact us, we only use your personal information

              <p>
                <strong>2. The App</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                2.1 Subject to the terms of this EULA, the App is made available to you free of charge. The App does not
                connect to any computer system (other than the Device on which you install it) and does not gather or
                transmit to us or any other person any data in relation to you or your use of the App.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.2 You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to and use of the
                App. You should not allow any other person to access and/or use the App on your Device. .
              </p>
              <p>
                2.3 The App and the content on it are provided for general information purposes only. They are not
                intended to amount to advice on which you should rely.
              </p>
              <p>2.4 You may only access and/or use the App for your own domestic, private and non-commercial use.</p>
              <p>
                2.5 Subject to clause 2.6, the App (once downloaded on to a Device in accordance with this EULA) is
                designed to enable you to:
              </p>
              <p>
                2.5.1 generate private keys using a recovery phrase (&quot;<strong>Private Key(s</strong>)&quot;) and a
                corresponding public key and store them on such Device;
              </p>
              <p>
                2.5.2 verify and sign transactions on Blockchains (as defined below) using the relevant Private Key
                (&quot;
                <strong>Digital Signature</strong>&quot;); and
              </p>
              <p>
                2.5.3 when used in conjunction with certain Third Party Services (which are defined in clause 4.3), can
                be used to broadcast transactions on the relevant Blockchains,
              </p>
              <p>
                (the &quot;<strong>App</strong> <strong>Functionality</strong>&quot;).
              </p>
              <p>
                2.6 The App Functionality the App, can only be used on the Ethereum public blockchain protocol,
                blockchain protocols built on our &quot;Substrate&quot; technology, including Kusama and Polkadot, and
                other blockchain protocols as are indicated within the App itself (&quot;<strong>Blockchain(s)</strong>
                &quot;). You are responsible for your choice of and interaction with the relevant Blockchain.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.7 The App is not itself part of any blockchain. For this reason, we will have no liability to you in
                relation to any activity on any blockchain or the performance or availability of any blockchain. In
                addition, we do not guarantee that a Digital Signature will result in the related transaction being
                recorded on the relevant Blockchain. You are responsible for ensuring that any transactions you
                broadcast, or Digital Signatures you create, conform to the applicable rules of the relevant Blockchain.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.8 You should only download, access and/or use the App if you are familiar with interacting with the
                Blockchains. We recommend you learn about and understand the basics of the Blockchains in connection
                with which you intend to use the App before downloading, accessing and/or using the App.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.9 The purpose of the App is to provide the App Functionality on a Device which is not connected to any
                form network or the internet. The App should only ever be used on an offline Device. Once you have
                downloaded, installed and set up the App on the Device, it is very important that you follow the
                instructions we provide on our website (available{' '}
                <em>
                  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer">here</a>
                </em>
                ) to ensure the Device is not connected to any network or the internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.10 You are responsible for the use and security of any Device on which you have installed the App. We
                will have no liability to you for any losses or damages you incur in respect of (i) access and/or use of
                the App (including the creation of any Digital Signature or loss of Private Keys) as a result of
                unauthorised persons gaining access to your Device; or (ii) your Device being compromised or corrupted.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Your account and password</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                3.1 You will need to register an account on the App in order to make full use of the App (&quot;
                <strong>Account</strong>&quot;). If you register an Account, you will be asked to provide certain
                information (such as your email address) and to create a pin code and a seed recovery phrase, as part of
                our security procedures. The information relating to your Account is never transmitted to us. You must
                treat such pin code and recovery phrase as confidential and you must not disclose it to any third party.
                Your recovery phrase is used to generate your Private Key, so if you lose your recovery phase, you will
                not be able to regenerate your Private Key to recover your Account. This may mean you are unable to
                access any digital currency, token and cryptocurrency associated with such Private Keys and/or create
                any Digital Signatures. You should ensure that you have taken appropriate steps to securely back-up any
                of your data stored on your Device (including the recovery phrase and Private Keys) so that such data is
                accessible in these circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                3.2 You are responsible for any unauthorised access and/or use of your App or Account login details.

              <p>
                4.3 When you make use of the App, you may use the App Functionality to enter into transactions on the
                relevant Blockchain (for example, transferring crypto currency, entering into a smart contract, or
                purchasing goods) (<strong>Transactions</strong>). You may also use the App in conjunction with other
                services or software (including cryptographic wallet technology such as software wallets) which are
                provided by a person or company other than Parity (<strong>Third Party Services</strong>). You agree and
                understand that you are responsible for any Transaction which you enter into and we do not operate or
                control any such Third Party Services. We have no responsibility for any Transactions you enter into and
                your use of Third Party Services is at your sole risk and we provide no warranty or guarantee of any in

                of any such Third Party Services or for any information that such Third Party Services provider provides
                you or you to them.

              <p>
                4.5 You must not misuse the App by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or other

                <strong>5. Intellectual property</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                5.1 As we refer to above, we grant to you a licence to use the software code in the App on the terms of
                GPL 3.0. This right does not apply to the Parity name and mark, the Parity Signer product names, and any
                texts, designs, graphics, photographs and images contained in the App, which you are not entitled to use
                (other than through the use of the App on your Device in accordance with this EULA) or modify in any

              <p>

              <p>
                <strong>6. Our liability</strong>
              </p>
              <p>6.1 Nothing in this EULA excludes or limits our liability for:</p>
              <p>6.1.1 death or personal injury caused by our negligence;</p>
              <p>6.1.2 fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; and</p>
              <p>
                6.1.3 any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for us to exclude or restrict our liability.
              </p>
              <p>
                6.2 The App is built on open source software and made available in accordance with this agreement as an
                open source community project. Accordingly, we make the App (and both the source code and object code in

                back-up any of your data (including any Private Keys) stored on your Device so that it is not lost in
                these circumstances. Save if we cause damage to your Device or other digital content and such damage
                would not have occurred if we had exercised reasonable care and skill, as the App is free for you to
                access and/or use and we receive no data in relation to you from your use of it, we will not be liable
                to you in any way if the App stops working properly or at all, including where any data stored in the
                App is lost or corrupted.

                <strong>7. Suspension and termination</strong>

              </p>
              <p>7.3 If we withdraw your right to use the App, then:</p>

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>8. Changes to this EULA</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                8.1 We may make changes to the terms of this EULA from time to time (if, for example, there is a change
                in the law that means we need to change this EULA). Please check this EULA (at the address indicated in
                clause 1.1) regularly to ensure that you understand the up-to-date terms that apply at the time that you
                access and use the App. If we update the terms of this EULA, the updated terms will apply 10 days after
                the update is posted (at the address indicated in clause 1.1) to each of your uses of the App from that
                point on.
              </p>
              <p>
                8.2 From time to time updates to the App may be issued through the relevant app store. As the App is
                designed to operate on a Device which remains offline, you agree that it is your responsibility to check
                whether we have published any updates to the App. You should carry out this check on a device on which
                the App has not been installed and follow our instructions (available at{' '}
                <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer">
                  <em>https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer</em>
                </a>
                ) as to how to update the App.
              </p>
              <p>
                8.3 You will be assumed to have obtained permission from the owners of any Devices that are controlled,
                but not owned, by you to download a copy of the App onto the Devices. You and they may be charged by
                your and their service providers for Internet access on the Devices. You accept responsibility in
                accordance with the terms of this EULA for the use of the App in relation to any Device, whether or not
                it is owned by you.

                <strong>9. Other important information</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                9.1 Each of the clauses of this EULA operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides
                that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining clauses will remain in full force and
                effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                9.2 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this EULA, or if we do not
                enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our
                rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do
                waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically
                waive any later default by you.
              </p>
              <p>

                <strong>10. Governing law and jurisdiction</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                10.1 This EULA is governed by English law. This means that your download, access to, and use of, the
                App, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection therewith will be governed by English law.
              </p>
              <p>
                10.2 You can bring proceedings in respect of this EULA in the English courts. However, as a consumer, if
                you live in another European Union member state you can bring legal proceedings in respect of this EULA
                in either the English courts or the courts of that Member State.
              </p>
              <p>
                10.3 As a consumer, if you are resident in the European Union and we direct this App to the member state
                in which you are resident, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in
                which you are resident. Nothing in this EULA, including clause 10.1, affects your rights as a consumer
                to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.

                <strong>APPENDIX 1</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Additional App Terms</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The following terms and conditions shall apply to your access and/or use of the App in addition to those
                set out in this EULA.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the purpose of this appendix 1, &quot;<strong>Appstore Provider</strong>&quot; means the provider of
                the app store through which you have downloaded the App (for example, Apple is the Appstore Provider if
                you have downloaded the App from the Apple App Store, Google is the Appstore Provider if you have
                downloaded the App from Google Play, etc).
              </p>
              <p>
                You acknowledge and agree that this EULA has been concluded between you and Parity, and not with the
                Appstore Provider. You acknowledge and agree that the Appstore Provider is not responsible for the App
                and its content.
              </p>
              <p>
                You acknowledge and agree that the Appstore Provider has no obligation to provide any maintenance or
                support in respect of the App. Should you have any problems in using the App, please contact us at{' '}
                <a href="mailto:legal@parity.io">legal@parity.io</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the event that the App does not conform with any product warranty provided for by this EULA, the
                Appstore Provider may provide you with a refund of the price that you paid to purchase the App (if any).
                The Appstore Provider shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, have no obligation to you
                whatsoever with respect to the App.
              </p>
              <p>
                You acknowledge and agree that the Appstore Provider shall not be responsible for addressing any claims
                that you might have relating to the App, including (without limitation): product liability claims; any
                claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and claims
                arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the event that a third party claims that the App infringes its intellectual property rights, Parity
                (and not the Appstore Provider) shall be solely responsible for the investigation, defence, settlement
                and discharge of such claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                You warrant and represent that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.
                Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a &quot;terrorist
                supporting&quot; country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or
                restricted parties.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the Appstore Provider is Apple, you acknowledge and agree that Apple and its subsidiaries are third
                party beneficiaries to this EULA. Upon your acceptance of this EULA, Apple will have the right to
                enforce the EULA against you as a third party beneficiary.
