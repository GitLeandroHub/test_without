## The Social Media Paradox

When a new wave of technology emerges, it creates new opportunities for freedom of information. In order to handle this information, a social dynamic emerges that pits two fundamental requirements against each other: public good and freedom of expression.

Since the recent acquisition of Twitter, the control of what is published on social networks and social media has been at the centre of the public debate. On one side we have those who say misinformation and conspiracy theories are still free speech, on the other, we have the government apparatus and powerful corporations trying to shape and control the public conversation. And neither contribute to a more peaceful society.

What if we had markets to curate and assess the value of information? And those markets could be used as a tool for arbitrating consensual opposites.

## Content Moderation.

One of the biggest limitations on freedom of expression in social and media networks is content moderation. From moral content gatekeepers and fact checkers  to Intelligence Services limiting your right to publish or the right to use the platform, rules are made in secret by a closed group or by individual agents. Other problems are the scale of the networks, automated content moderation, and “deepfake” with manipulated video stories and images that induce a fake reality. 

In the Kinera network, all participation has meaning; an economic and symbolic value. Fair and inclusive rules for all members are taken  seriously as  the economic value of the network is tied to the value of the information it produces. To enforce common responsibility, the moderation system is controlled by the members of the community.  This platform is designed to include all voices.

To moderate Kineras’ digital public sphere we propose two strategies: the first is to gamify the user experience by rewarding positive behaviour, and the second, is to create different levels of user experience. Participants will avoid disruptive behaviour because they don’t want to miss token rewards or lose the functionalities that their personal reputation allows them to access.

## A global community

Journalism is being put into question on a daily basis. The asymmetry in the social value information dictates government politics and new public laws for its citizens. At the same time, the “vox populi, vox dei” impose rules in social media with nothing at stake. The difference between fascism and democracy is becoming less clear. 

At the same time, the acceleration of the human relations that technology promotes is making the world smaller. Web3 opens the possibility to escape  the financial restrictions of geography and  having to use specific  intermediaries. This has consequences and benefits that have  yet to  reverberate in the physical world.  By funding anonymous media creators we can build high-quality structured television channels with content that challenge  fascist regimes. Looking at the way the world works, do you think we can have freedom of expression without anonymous media financing? Bringing people out of the isolation and alienation of political decisions or algorithmic interference will produce changes in power relations. 

We do not pretend to know what narratives will emerge, but we want to facilitate the process. We are not alone, platforms for independent media creation are the place to find the voices and the alliances forging a new global civil society. 

## What makes us different

Kinera will be an open and free protocol with some fundamental differences when compared to other social media:

* We rank and classify content at scale without the use of algorithms. 
* The moderation is made by a self-regulated antifragile community.
* Assertive participation gives the user reputation and platform tokens.
* Participants have full control over the content seen in their feed.
    
## Funding

The time to present our funding event to the public is getting closer. Because of the curation function  of the token, and to balance  users' voting  power  when we bootstrap the network, all funding events will be capped.

This text is our first call and a shout-out to people who believe that organic beings classify information better than algorithms, and agree that social consensus around the value of information can be reached while creating an economy based on community values.

You're invited. Let’s build together!
