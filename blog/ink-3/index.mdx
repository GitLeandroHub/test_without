## The Social Media Paradox

When a new wave of information technology emerges, we start to have more sources and more space for its dissemination, this leads to more complexity in the social landscape, and to the arising of conflicts on two important grounded rules for democracy: the public good and freedom of expression.

With Twitter's acquisition [now X], the control over what was published on social networks and social media during COVID-19 times jumped to the centre of the public debate. On one side, we have those who say misinformation and conspiracy theories are still free speech; on the other, we have the government apparatus and powerful corporations trying to shape and control the public conversation. And neither contributes to a more peaceful society.

What if we had markets to curate and assess the value of information? And those markets could be used as a tool for arbitrating consensual opposites.

## Content Moderation.

Content moderation became one of the most significant limitations on freedom of expression in our social and media networks. From moral content gatekeepers and fact-checkers to the allowance for Intelligence Services to limit your right to publish or use a platform or rules made in secret by a closed group or individual agents. Other problems are the scale of the networks, automated content moderation, and “deepfake” with manipulated video stories and images that induce a fake reality. 

In the Kinera network all participation has meaning, an economic and symbolic value. As the economic value of the network is tied to the value of the information it produces, fair and inclusive rules are taken seriously. To enforce shared responsibility, the members control the moderation system.  

We moderate Kinera’s digital public sphere using two strategies: first, we gamify the user experience by rewarding positive behaviour, and second, we create different levels of user experience. Participants will avoid disruptive behaviour because they don’t want to miss token rewards or lose the functionalities their reputation allows them to access.

## A global community

As journalism is daily questioned, the asymmetry in the social value information dictates government politics and new public laws for its citizens. When the “vox populi, vox dei” impose rules in social media with nothing at stake, the difference between authoritarianism and social relations is blurred. 

At the same time, the acceleration of the human relations that technology promotes is making the world smaller. Web3 opens the possibility of escaping the financial restrictions of geography and the use of a restricted number of intermediaries. This has consequences and benefits that have yet to reverberate in the physical world. By funding anonymous media creators, we can build high-quality structured television channels with content that challenges totalitarian regimes. 

Bringing people out of the isolation and alienation of political decisions or algorithmic interference will produce changes in power relations that structured the world as we know it. We do not pretend to know what narratives will emerge but want to facilitate the process. A platform for independent media creation is the place to find the voices and the alliances forging a new global civil society. 

## What makes us different

Kinera’s protocol has fundamental differences when compared to other streaming media:

* We rank and classify content at scale without the use of algorithms. 
* A self-regulated antifragile community makes the moderation.
* Assertive participation gives the user reputation and platform tokens.
* Participants have complete control over the content seen in their feed.
    
## Funding

The time to present our funding event to the public is approaching. Because of the token curation functions and to balance users' voting power at network launch, all funding events will be capped.

This text is a call and a shout-out to the people who believe that organic beings classify information better than algorithms. If you agree that a social consensus around the value of information can be reached while creating an economy based on community values, let’s build together!
