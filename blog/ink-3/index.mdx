## Presenting Kinera’s Minimum Viable Product [MVP] on testnet. 

After two years of study and hard work, the InvisibleHandLab team [https://invisiblehandlab.org/] presents Kinera, a blockchain-powered community built upon a social network engineered for collaborative curation and moderation, audiovisual content streaming and co-creation. 

Kinera is open to everyone, regardless of background or location, curators, creators and newcomers can engage with their passion for audiovisual content. Our goal is to revolutionise the way we discover, discuss, and rank audiovisual content. The use of tokens in a gamified environment encourages the creation of contests, festivals, rankings and specialised channels.

The present release of the platform is a minimum-viable product, with him we want to test its basic features and give users an opportunity to engage with the platform and discover its potential in a controlled testnet environment.

To start using the application, you need to have a <strong> Polkadot JS Wallet and some tokens </strong> to play with. The tokens enable you to rank films and videos and vote on constellations on the platform.

## 1. To Create a Polkadot JS Wallet, follow the written instructions 

https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000098878-how-to-create-a-dot-account  or the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy7lvAqyzkY 

## 2. To Transfer Play Tokens to Your Wallet, open the link

In this test run, Kinera is making “play tokens” available to users to test the platform:

-Transfer 10,000 tokens from “Alice” to your wallet, 
-Sign and submit
-Close the window

The first step is to launch our dApp on the Kinera [https://kinera.network/ ] website and create a Personal  Profile. Go to the “Create a New Profile” and follow the instructions.

In Kinera, users classify content using tokenised voting and allocation mechanisms. 

When you rank content on Rankings, you get an 18% fixed annual reward on your tokens, provided you retain them on the lists throughout that period. 

When you create Constellations - competitions where users vote for their favourite videos and films - as a reward, you get 2% of the total number of tokens used in the voting process. If you vote for the winning movies and videos of other users, you receive tokens from those who voted for less popular options. 

In this Alfa 1.0 release, you can:

1. Propose and evaluate films and videos in the Rankings.

2. Constellations: You can propose video or film competitions by submitting lists of content others can vote on or vote on other users' proposals. 

3. See the best videos from the constellation's best films on SEE channels. The creation of Streaming Video Channels from this list will come later. 

4. The Social Page shows the social interactions from the users you follow. You can engage with them by commenting on their posts and preferences here. 

5. In your public profile, you can publish or talk about the content you like best. In this profile, the constellations you create are automatically released.
