- Empowering Video Distribution and Streaming through Token Curation. 

After two years of study and development, the InvisibleHandLab <a href="https://invisiblehandlab.org">team</a> presents Kinera, a blockchain-powered community built upon a social network engineered for collaborative curation and moderation, audiovisual content streaming and co-creation. 

Kinera is open to everyone, regardless of background or location. In our platform, curators, creators and newcomers can engage with their passion for audiovisual content. The gamified environment encourages the creation of competitions we call constellations, rankings and specialised channels. The goal is to revolutionise the way we discover, discuss, and rank audiovisual content.

Our first public release is a minimum viable product, where we can show future basic features and offer the opportunity to discover its potential in a controlled testnet environment.

The first step is to launch our dApp on the <a href="https://kinera.network">Kinera</a> website. To start using the application, you need a <strong> Polkadot JS Wallet and some testnet </strong> tokens. 

1. To Create a Polkadot JS Wallet, follow:
- The written <a href="https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000098878-how-to-create-a-dot-account">instructions</a>
- Or the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy7lvAqyzkY">video</a>. 

  
2. To Transfer Play Tokens to Your Wallet:
- Open the <a href="https://nodleprotocol.io/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fnode0.kinera.network#/extrinsics">link</a>. 
- Go to accounts and press transfer;
- Transfer 1000 tokens from “Alice” to your wallet;
- Sign and submit;
- Close the window;
- See the video with the details <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/qzt7qnyvOJU?feature=share">here</a>. 
 

In Kinera, users classify content using tokenised voting and allocation mechanisms. 

When you rank content on <strong> Rankings </strong>, you get an <strong> 18% fixed annual reward </strong> on your tokens, provided you retain them on the lists throughout that period. 

When you create <strong> Constellations </strong> - competitions where users vote for their favorite videos and films - as a reward, <strong> you get 2% of the total number of tokens used in the voting process.</strong> If you vote for the winning movies and videos of other users, you receive tokens from those who voted for less popular options. 

In this Alfa 1.0 release, you can:

1. Propose and evaluate films and videos in the Rankings.
2. Constellations: You can propose video or film competitions by submitting lists of content others can vote on or vote on other users' proposals. 
3. See the best videos from the constellation's best films on SEE channels. The creation of Streaming Video Channels from this list will come later. 
4. The Social Page shows the social interactions from the users you follow. You can engage with them by commenting on their posts and preferences here. 
5. In your public profile, you can publish or talk about the content you like best. In this profile, the constellations you create are automatically released.
