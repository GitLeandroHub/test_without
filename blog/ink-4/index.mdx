We live in the shadow of Artificial Intelligence's potential threat. Part of the scientific community is united to advocate for a deceleration in technological development. Journalists amplify the narrative, and the general public embrace it. All this is in the absence of a tangible, formally articulated threat.

As the <strong>harvest of personal data</strong> continues, pieces of our digital selves feed algorithms that map, simulate and predict human actions regarding everything from “what we will be buying next?” to our “most intimate and private behaviour and thoughts”.

What other purpose can our personal data serve? Personal data accumulation is helpful in training algorithms and simulating real individuals. In the eagerness to make this exploitation profitable, we can expect a level of perfection where our bodies and minds are not needed anymore. If we imagine such experiments being conducted, they are likely already underway.  

We saw the 20th century unfold as a tale where the media gave structure and context to centralised power groups and institutions, crafting an illusion of freedom and diversity of political choice.

With artificial intelligence being controlled by the same entities that run social networks and the media, we will end up in a world with human minds being simulated inside machines built to create non-events to entertain us. To prevent these dystopias, we need an alternative future that frees us from the negative limitations of current platforms. The key lies in separating the media from economic and political powers. This can be achieved by embracing technology that employs decentralised <strong>protocols owned and managed by a community of users.</strong> This approach would free us from the influence of advertising and algorithms, ensuring a safer and more user-focused environment.

The KINERA platform is an open-source project that aims to eliminate the layers of manipulation embedded in the media through curatorial decision-making processes and tools for independent creation.

The technological innovations in the Web 3.0 protocols open a new world of possibilities, from direct access to information to censorship resistance and improved privacy. Blockchain technology enables resilient, decentralised networks to be created, controlled, and curated by humans.

Our perception of the world is becoming heavily influenced by the digital realm. The internet is the primary source of news, entertainment, and factual and cultural content. Therefore, it is paramount that we have access to information that we can independently evaluate and assess in a knowable context – the context of who creates, publishes and curates.

On the Kinera platform, the content producer is supported by a community of users that curate, vote/stake and subscribe to his products. Artists manage their content and create revenue through smart contracts. The token economy is designed to encourage people's participation in pursuing quality content relevant to their lives.

It is no secret how difficult it can be to finance any film, documentary, or audiovisual material.

By creating a market where content creators, even in an anonymous way, can present future projects, we believe we can help artists break this barrier and that this can lead to a greater diversity of stories, shifting our perception of the world we live in.

Many of us feel that the world is at a crossroads and that we need new approaches to solve our problems. Kinera wants to be the place for alternative narratives and new  thinking to reflect the diversity of cultures, political solutions, stories, and human experiences, where many ways of engaging with and thinking about the world can emerge.

And you're invited to participate!
