You should therefore read the terms carefully before downloading, accessing\n                and/or using the App. If any written instruction we have given you is inconsistent with the terms set\n                out in this document, you should comply with our instructions and in doing so you will not be in breach\n                of the inconsistent term of this document.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                1.2 When certain words and phrases are used in this EULA, they have specific meanings (these are known\n                as &quot;<strong>defined terms</strong>&quot;). You can identify these defined terms because they start\n                with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it\n                has the meaning given to it in the section of this EULA where it was defined (you can find these\n                meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included in brackets and speech marks).\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                1.3 In order to access and/or use the App it must be downloaded on to a smartphone or other mobile\n                device running either the iOS or Android operating systems (the device you use, &quot;\n                <strong>Device</strong>\n                &quot;).

You are responsible for your choice of and interaction with the relevant Blockchain.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                2.7 The App is not itself part of any blockchain. For this reason, we will have no liability to you in\n                relation to any activity on any blockchain or the performance or availability of any blockchain. In\n                addition, we do not guarantee that a Digital Signature will result in the related transaction being\n                recorded on the relevant Blockchain. You are responsible for ensuring that any transactions you\n                broadcast, or Digital Signatures you create, conform to the applicable rules of the relevant Blockchain.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                2.8 You should only download, access and/or use the App if you are familiar with interacting with the\n                Blockchains. We recommend you learn about and understand the basics of the Blockchains in connection\n                with which you intend to use the App before downloading, accessing and/or using the App.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                2.9 The purpose of the App is to provide the App Functionality on a Device which is not connected to any\n                form network or the internet. The App should only ever be used on an offline Device. Once you have\n                downloaded, installed and set up the App on the Device, it is very important that you follow the\n                instructions we provide on our website (available{' '}\n                <em>\n                  <a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer\">here</a>\n                </em>\n                ) to ensure the Device is not connected to any network or the internet.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                2.10 You are responsible for the use and security of any Device on which you have installed the App. We\n                will have no liability to you for any losses or damages you incur in respect of (i) access and/or use of\n                the App (including the creation of any Digital Signature or loss of Private Keys) as a result of\n                unauthorised persons gaining access to your Device; or (ii) your Device being compromised or corrupted.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                <strong>3. Your account and password</strong>\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                3.1 You will need to register an account on the App in order to make full use of the App (&quot;\n                <strong>Account</strong>&quot;). If you register an Account, you will be asked to provide certain\n                information (such as your email address) and to create a pin code and a seed recovery phrase, as part of\n                our security procedures. The information relating to your Account is never transmitted to us. You must\n                treat such pin code and recovery phrase as confidential and you must not disclose it to any third party.\n                Your recovery phrase is used to generate your Private Key, so if you lose your recovery phase, you will\n                not be able to regenerate your Private Key to recover your Account. This may mean you are unable to\n                access any digital currency, token and cryptocurrency associated with such Private Keys and/or create\n                any Digital Signatures. You should ensure that you have taken appropriate steps to securely back-up any\n                of your data stored on your Device (including the recovery phrase and Private Keys) so that such data is\n                accessible in these circumstances.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                3.2 You are responsible for any unauthorised access and/or use of your App or Account login details.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                <strong>4.
