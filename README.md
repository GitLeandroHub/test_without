## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone this Repo**

2.  **Get Setup**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and install all dependencies.

    ```shell
    cd blog-kinera
    yarn
    ```

3.  **Development Server**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and use the following command to start the development server locally, once the dependencies have been installed.

    ```shell
    cd blog-kinera
    yarn develop
    ```

4.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!
    And your GraphiQL data layer is running at `http://localhost:8000/__graphql`

    Edit to see your site update in real-time!

## Troubleshooting

Make sure to follow the following steps in order to troubleshoot any development issues:

1. Version
   `NodeJS`: 14 (v14.19.3, use `.nvmrc`)
   `GatsbyCLI`: 2.26.1
   Before installing new plugins (especially for gatsby), make sure which version of CLI is supported.

2. Clear Cache (for runtime errors)
   use `yarn clean` if the server is stale or having issues reloading in your browser of choice.
